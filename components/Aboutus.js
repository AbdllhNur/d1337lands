      [+] We are ofcourse the creator of this thing (and almost everything since 2017 in daskom were, are and probably will always be created by us) including the <a href="https://daskomlab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">daskomlab web application</a> that daskom is using for everyday practicum. <br /><br />

      [+] We also have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl51jsRs074Ve1cyXxrbhxA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">youtube channel</a> with running lists of videos that will probably and hopefully gives you knowledge and understanding about magic, science, and crafts in the digital world. <br /><br />

      [+] We hold several events to give knowledge for free for all of you (and us) which are <a href="https://github.com/Daskom-Lab/weekend-crash-course" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">weekend crash course</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Daskom-Lab/2021-Academy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prochef academy</a> and <a href="https://daskom-lab.github.io/daskomctf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">capture the flag</a>.
