Ever heard about this one ? you know when some of daskom1337 people are talking about PR, this is what they meant, its Pull Request.

Pull request is easy, just remember what pull command does in git, and then this one is basically creating a request such that instead of you who pull other's changes, its actually the other way around.

It would be much easier to understand this by using it directly, so these are the things that you have to do to complete the last section of Git and Github Course, yes you read it correctly:

[*] By the way, if you dont understand each of the steps here, you can ask the mentors, your friends, or even your parents (if they are software engineers :D).

[1] By now, you should have had a d1337lands directory in your local from the forked repository in your account, good, this is just sanity check, now move on

[2] Next, go to that directory and then create and checkout to a new branch called "development"

[3] Go to webservice/assets directory and create an html file containing your own ascii art (this could be anything, your face, your waifu face, your alternate identity, whatever), to do this you can convert image to ascii and put it in the html file directly (see the existing html files as examples), name this file "{your name}.html"

[4] Stage the file and commit it using the commit message of "add {your name} ascii art"

[5] Now open the peoples.js file and add a new object (you probably have not understand what this actually is, but its fine) by simply copying this one example below and change it to your own willingness:
```
{
    Avatar: "{your name}.html",
    Handle: "{your username, altname, whatever you want the internet to call you}",
    Realname: "{your real fullname, the real one okay!}",
    Description: `
+------------------------------------------------+
|       put anything here, anything really       |
+------------------------------------------------+`,
},
```

[6] Copy the edited example above to the very bottom of the code in peoples.js file, if you dont understand where to copy, dont worry, just follow the existing one.

[7] Now stage the changes again and commit it with message of "add {your name} to peoples.js"

[8] Push all the changes to your newly created branch called "development", you might be facing with a warning that says the branch is not existed yet in the remote target, just follow the command shown on the warning and you will be good to go.

[9] After this, go to github and open the Daskom-Lab/d1337lands repository (remember the Daskom-Lab one, not your own forked repository), and then click on the pull request section in the top menu bar, and click `new pull request` button with green color on it.

[10] Now you should be able to see that there is `base: main <- compare: main` thing there, so the ones on the left side of the arrow is the target branch in which you want your changes be placed on the Daskom-Lab/d1337lands repository, meanwhile the ones on the right side of the arrow is the one you want to change to the "development" branch of your own forked repository, change it by clicking on the dropdown button there.

[11] And then you can click on the `Create pull request` button, and follow these steps:
     - for title, set it as "chore: add {your name} as daskom1337 community member"
     - for description, describe what you just did in the previous 2 commits you have done before (use your creativity, dont ask your friend what to write, think!)
     - and then on the reviewers part on the right side of the screen, click on the setting button with the gear icon on it, and put `fakhrip, soedipo, iritasee, adhiiimf` as reviewer, just click it and until you see green check besides each name
     - thats it, then click the create pull request button or whatever button that will create the pull request :v

[12] Done, congratulations on your (probably) first ever pull request!

Also congratulations for finishing this course, see you on the next one (web frontend development).
