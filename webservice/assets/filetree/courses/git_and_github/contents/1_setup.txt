The very first thing that you have to do is to create an account in github.com if you haven't done that by simply going to `https://github.com/signup`.

After you have an account on github, now lets go to the next step, install the git cli application, and remember we will always use CLI (Command Line Interface) from now on, so make yourself comfortable in using it!
