| Challenge #1 |
+--------------+---
| > To make sure that you are totally following all the contents in the
|   courses, this first challenge is about creating *the exact* same thing
|   in the courses
|
| > So what you have to do is to create a repository in your own github
|   account and put every single files and changes that are mentioned in
|   the courses itself
|
| [*] Once you have done this challenge, you have to give your github
|     repository link in the prochef academy discord channel so the mentors
|     can see it and give a score based on what you have done
|
|     Note: score here is just a number for the mentors to see how far
|           you have learn about something

| Challenge #2 |
+--------------+
| > [ALERT] Sorry, due to some conditions this second challenge has been changed
|
| > So instead of adding some javascripts to the last website you made in the 
|   previous challenge, here you have to create one more, its your own website !!!
|
| > But of course, its not a challenge if it doesn't have *requirements* right ?
|   so here are all the requirements you need to meet:
|
|   [1] Do not use any web framework (not even something like bootstrap or tailwindcss)
|       *except* javascript libraries that will help you when writing javascript codes
|       (you can and should ask the mentors in the discord channel first for this one)
|   [2] Use only native HTML, CSS, and Javascripts
|   [3] There should be one user interaction at minimal, these are things that count as 
|       user interactions:
|
|       -> Button click triggered animation / control such as page changes or scroll 
|          to top kind of things
|       -> Page scroll triggered animation 
|          (i.e https://greensock.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollTrigger or 
|               https://css-tricks.com/scroll-triggered-animation-vanilla-javascript/)
|       -> Contact page (a working one, connected to a backend if you can, and if you 
|          need help for this one, chat in the discord channel and all the mentors will 
|          be helping you out for sure)
|       -> Animations even without user interaction counted as user interaction in this
|          case (well, the user still need their eye to interact with the animation 
|          right ? wkwk)
|
| [*] Remember that you might want to read the 26_references.txt content to help you out
| [*] You can follow tutorials to create the personal website, and follow all the code there
|     but please add something that will make it unique to yourself
|
| > To do this challenge, you have to create a repository called "{your_username}.github.io"
|   in your github account first
|
| [*] Once you have done this challenge, you have to give your github
|     repository link in the prochef academy discord channel so the mentors
|     can see it and give a score based on what you have done
|
|     Note: score here is just a number for the mentors to see how far
|           you have learn about something
|
| [*] And one last thing, if you have done this challenge and the mentors approved it, you 
|     can go to https://idcloudhost.com/domain/ find your own domain name that you want to 
|     have, and me [FAI] will buy the domain for you (maximum Rp25.000 for the price)
|
|     Note: to get such a cheap price for a domain, you can try to find one that ends with
|           .xyz or .my.id or something else (this is called TLD, Top Level Domain)
